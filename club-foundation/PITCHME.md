# Our Goals

1. To create a *technically competent* community of CV-AI and vision experimenters.
2. To create noticeable impact with this team.

+++

* Imperative for team to share a goal

+++ 

# Area of Operation

* Benefit of being in a niche between research labs and razer focussed startups.

---

# Execution Plans

Twofold:

1. Build and monitor team's technical expertise. (Projects)
2. Keystone events to aim for / exhibit this.

---

### Work we take up

* Projects of two kinds

1. Impactful real world projects
2. Academic oriented ones (in house tech)

+++

### Impact projects

* Deploy to see results

* May not be as technically challenging

* Getting it to work in env is harder

+++

### Academic projects

* Hallmark topics plus areas

* To improve in-house expertise

+++

* Areas : (subject to discussion)

 1. Pattern recognition, DL with associated NLP
 2. Robotic vision
 3. Deep RL
 4. DL in computational photography

+++

* Can look at goals of papers plus patents
