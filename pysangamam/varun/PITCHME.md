# Engineering documentation for scientific python

_Varun Sundar_
_Draft Slides, 20th July 2018_

## Disclaimer

* Most of this presentation is with scientific python use cases as an instance

* May be more generally applicable. 

* Encouraged to fork out your own inference of this !

---

## The Problem at hand

Well good documentation is an utopian concept.

Does it even exist?

+++

We all know how crucial documentation can be.

Do we?

---

## Caution : Numbers ahead!

* Stack overflow developer survey 2016

* An annual survey of developer practices, issues, popular opinions 
_(tabs vs spaces anyone?)_

* ![Challenges-at-work](pysangamam/varun/stackoverflow-challenges-2016.png)

+++

* Comes in at no 2

* Poor docs or inexistent docs or inconsistent docs

* no's 1,3 are related to communication too

---

## Let's step back a bit ...

* Most reasons >> docs don't give you what you _actually_ need.

* sort of like this...

* ![bridge-out-ahead](https://i.imgflip.com/20tthj.jpg)

+++

## Or...

* Docs are out of date.

* Obsolete docs can be more harmful than no docs.

---

## Bad Docs

Hurts :

* Reliability and reproducability of code
* Slows down OSS usage

+++

## Scientific use cases

* Even more important

* Many more updates in code

* Apparent age scale has dropped >> Quicker dev cycles.
